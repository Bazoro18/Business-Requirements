# Business Requirements Reference Cards - Complete Study Guide

## üìã Card 1: Requirement Gathering Fundamentals

### üìñ Detailed Explanation
Requirement gathering is the systematic process of collecting, analyzing, and documenting what a business needs from a software or data solution. It involves understanding three key dimensions: functional requirements (what the system should do), non-functional requirements (how well the system should perform), and the distinction between business needs (strategic outcomes) and technical needs (implementation details).

**Key Components:**
- **Functional Requirements**: Specific behaviors, features, and capabilities the system must have
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Quality attributes like performance, security, usability, and reliability
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Identifying all people who influence or are influenced by the system
- **Business vs Technical Needs**: Separating strategic outcomes from implementation methods

### üè¢ Real-World Example
A retail bank wants to improve their mobile banking app:

**Business Need**: Increase customer satisfaction and reduce branch visits by 30%
**Functional Requirements**: 
- Transfer money between accounts
- Pay bills online
- View transaction history
- Deposit checks via photo

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- Load time under 3 seconds
- 99.9% uptime
- Bank-grade security encryption
- Support for users with disabilities

## üìà Card 2: KPI & Metric Definition

### üìñ Detailed Explanation
KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and metrics are measurable values that demonstrate how effectively a business is achieving its key objectives. In software and data engineering, we need to define three types of metrics: Business KPIs (strategic outcomes), Operational metrics (process efficiency), and Data KPIs (data quality and performance). These metrics should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

**Types of KPIs:**
- **Business KPIs**: Revenue, customer satisfaction, market share, conversion rates
- **Operational Metrics**: Process efficiency, error rates, throughput, resource utilization
- **Data KPIs**: Latency, freshness, accuracy, completeness, availability

### üè¢ Real-World Example
E-commerce platform launching a new recommendation engine:

**Business KPIs:**
- Increase average order value by 15% within 6 months
- Improve customer retention rate from 60% to 75%
- Boost conversion rate from 2.5% to 3.2%

**Operational Metrics:**
- Recommendation response time < 200ms
- System uptime > 99.9%
- Error rate < 0.1%

**Data KPIs:**
- Data freshness: Customer behavior data updated within 5 minutes
- Accuracy: Product catalog accuracy > 99.5%
- Latency: ML model inference time < 100ms

## üéØ Card 3: Use Case Identification

### üìñ Detailed Explanation
Use case identification involves discovering and documenting all the different ways users will interact with the system to achieve business goals. In data engineering, this includes distinguishing between transactional use cases (operational day-to-day activities) and analytical use cases (reporting, insights, decision-making). It also involves understanding data flow patterns and choosing the right processing approach (real-time, near-real-time, or batch) based on business requirements.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Transactional Use Cases**: CRUD operations, business processes, real-time decisions
- **Analytical Use Cases**: Reporting, dashboards, ML models, business intelligence
- **Data Flow Mapping**: Understanding how data moves from source to consumption
- **Processing Trade-offs**: Balancing speed, cost, and complexity

### üè¢ Real-World Example
A streaming media company building a content recommendation platform:

**Transactional Use Cases:**
- User watches a video (real-time tracking)
- User rates content (immediate feedback)
- Content gets uploaded (metadata processing)

**Analytical Use Cases:**
- Generate personalized recommendations (near-real-time)
- Create executive dashboards (batch processing)
- A/B test content algorithms (batch analysis)

**Data Flow & Processing Choices:**
- **Real-time**: Fraud detection during payment (< 1 second)
- **Near-real-time**: Update recommendations (5-15 minutes)
- **Batch**: Daily content performance reports (overnight processing)

## üèóÔ∏è Card 4: Source System Analysis

### üìñ Detailed Explanation
Source system analysis involves understanding where your data comes from, how it's structured, and what constraints exist for extracting it. This includes distinguishing between OLTP systems (optimized for transactions) and OLAP systems (optimized for analytics), assessing technical feasibility of data extraction, and establishing Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with data providers. This analysis is crucial for designing realistic data pipelines and setting proper expectations.

**Key Components:**
- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**: Operational databases, high volume transactions, normalized data
- **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**: Data warehouses, complex queries, denormalized data
- **Extraction Feasibility**: APIs, database connections, file transfers, real-time streams
- **SLA Considerations**: Uptime, refresh frequency, data quality guarantees

### üè¢ Real-World Example
A retail company building a customer analytics platform needs data from multiple sources:

**OLTP Sources:**
- E-commerce database (PostgreSQL): Customer orders, product catalog
- CRM system (Salesforce): Customer interactions, support tickets
- Inventory system (SAP): Stock levels, supplier data

**OLAP Sources:**
- Marketing data warehouse: Campaign performance, email metrics
- Financial system: Revenue, costs, profitability data

**Extraction Analysis:**
- E-commerce DB: REST API available, 1000 requests/hour limit
- Salesforce: Real-time streaming via Salesforce Streaming API
- SAP: Batch export files, updated nightly at 2 AM
- Marketing warehouse: Direct database connection during off-peak hours

## üìÑ Card 5: Defining Data Contracts

### üìñ Detailed Explanation
Data contracts are formal agreements that define expectations between data producers and consumers. They specify data structure (schema), quality requirements, delivery SLAs, and how changes will be handled. Think of them as APIs for data - they provide a stable interface that allows different teams to work independently while ensuring compatibility. Data contracts include schema definitions, data quality rules, backward compatibility requirements, and change management processes.

**Key Elements:**
- **Data Expectations**: Schema, data types, required fields, validation rules
- **Schema Evolution**: How structure changes are handled, versioning strategy
- **SLAs**: Availability, refresh frequency, latency requirements
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensuring changes don't break existing consumers

### üè¢ Real-World Example
An e-commerce platform defining a contract for customer order data:

**Data Contract: Customer Orders v2.1**

```json
{
  "schema": {
    "order_id": "string (required, unique)",
    "customer_id": "integer (required)",
    "order_date": "timestamp (required, ISO 8601)",
    "total_amount": "decimal(10,2) (required, >0)",
    "status": "enum [pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered, cancelled]",
    "items": "array (required, min_length: 1)"
  },
  "quality_rules": {
    "completeness": ">99% for required fields",
    "timeliness": "Available within 5 minutes of order creation",
    "accuracy": "Amount calculations must match order total"
  },
  "sla": {
    "availability": "99.9% uptime",
    "latency": "<5 minutes from source",
    "refresh_frequency": "Real-time streaming"
  }
}
```

**Backward Compatibility Example:**
- Version 2.0 ‚Üí 2.1: Added optional "delivery_notes" field (safe change)
- Version 1.x ‚Üí 2.0: Changed "amount" from integer to decimal (breaking change, requires migration)

### üìä Visual Representation

| **Quality Rules** | Data validation criteria | Completeness >99%, no nulls in key fields |
| **SLA** | Service level commitments | <5 min latency, 99.9% availability |
| **Evolution** | Change management policy | Backward compatible changes allowed |

### ‚úÖ Best Practices
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with core fields and expand gradually
2. **Version Everything**: Use semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
3. **Plan for Change**: Design schemas that can evolve without breaking consumers
4. **Document Thoroughly**: Include examples, validation rules, and business context
5. **Automate Validation**: Build automated testing for contract compliance
6. **Communicate Changes**: Establish clear processes for notifying consumers of changes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Challenges & Pitfalls

| Challenge | Why It Happens | Avoidance Strategy |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Breaking Changes** | Schema changes that break existing consumers | Use contract testing and gradual rollouts |
| **Ambiguous Contracts** | Unclear specifications lead to different interpretations | Provide concrete examples and test cases |
| **Contract Sprawl** | Too many versions and variations | Regular cleanup and consolidation |
| **Missing Validation** | Contracts not enforced in practice | Implement automated contract testing |
| **Poor Communication** | Changes not properly communicated | Establish change notification processes |

## üéØ Card 8: Prioritization & Roadmapping

### üìñ Detailed Explanation
Prioritization and roadmapping help teams focus on the most valuable requirements first, especially when resources are limited. This involves using structured frameworks like MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have), the Kano Model (classifying features by customer satisfaction impact), and Value vs. Effort analysis to make informed decisions about what to build and when. Effective prioritization balances business value, technical feasibility, and strategic alignment.

**Key Frameworks:**
- **MoSCoW**: Categorizes requirements by necessity and impact
- **Kano Model**: Classifies features by customer satisfaction impact
- **Value vs. Effort**: Plots requirements on a matrix to identify quick wins
- **Weighted Scoring**: Uses multiple criteria to rank requirements objectively

### üè¢ Real-World Example
A SaaS company prioritizing features for their customer analytics platform:

**MoSCoW Analysis:**
- **Must Have**: User authentication, basic dashboard, data export
- **Should Have**: Advanced filtering, custom reports, email alerts
- **Could Have**: Machine learning insights, mobile app, API access
- **Won't Have**: Social media integration, video tutorials, white labeling

**Kano Model Classification:**
- **Basic (Expected)**: System security, data accuracy, reasonable performance
- **Performance (More is Better)**: Dashboard load speed, number of metrics
- **Excitement (Delighters)**: AI-powered recommendations, predictive analytics

**Value vs. Effort Matrix:**
- **High Value, Low Effort (Quick Wins)**: Email alerts, data export
- **High Value, High Effort (Major Projects)**: Machine learning insights
- **Low Value, Low Effort (Fill-ins)**: UI theme customization
- **Low Value, High Effort (Avoid)**: Complex social media integrations

## üéñÔ∏è Card 9: Business-Driven Data Quality Requirements

### üìñ Detailed Explanation
Business-driven data quality requirements define the standards that data must meet to effectively support business decisions and operations. Unlike technical data quality metrics, these requirements are defined from a business perspective and focus on how data quality impacts business outcomes. The key dimensions are accuracy (correctness), completeness (presence of required data), and consistency (uniformity across systems), each with specific business-relevant definitions and thresholds.

**Core Quality Dimensions:**
- **Accuracy**: Data correctly represents the real-world entities or events it describes
- **Completeness**: All required data elements are present and populated
- **Consistency**: Data values are uniform and standardized across different systems and time periods
- **Timeliness**: Data is available when needed for business processes and decisions

### üè¢ Real-World Example
An e-commerce company defining data quality requirements for their customer analytics:

**Accuracy Requirements:**
- Customer email addresses: 99.5% valid format and deliverable
- Product prices: 100% match with inventory system (zero tolerance for pricing errors)
- Order totals: Must equal sum of line items within $0.01

**Completeness Requirements:**
- Customer profiles: 95% must have email, shipping address, and phone number

## üí∞ Card 10: Business Impact Mapping

### üìñ Detailed Explanation
Business impact mapping connects technical solutions to measurable business outcomes by analyzing Return on Investment (ROI), revenue impact, and customer experience improvements. This process helps justify project investments, prioritize features, and measure success. It involves quantifying both direct financial benefits (increased revenue, cost savings) and indirect benefits (improved customer satisfaction, competitive advantage) to create a comprehensive view of project value.

**Key Components:**
- **ROI Analysis**: Cost-benefit calculations, payback period, net present value
- **Revenue Impact**: Direct sales increases, cost reductions, efficiency gains
- **Customer Experience (CX) Link**: Satisfaction improvements, retention increases, loyalty building
- **Strategic Value**: Market positioning, competitive advantage, future opportunity enablement

### üè¢ Real-World Example
A retail bank implementing a real-time fraud detection system:

**ROI Analysis:**
- **Investment**: $2M development + $500K annual operations = $3M over 3 years
- **Benefits**: 
  - Fraud reduction: $5M/year in prevented losses
  - False positive reduction: $1M/year in operational savings
  - Customer satisfaction: $500K/year in retention value
- **ROI**: ($6.5M √ó 3 - $3M) / $3M = 550% ROI over 3 years

**Revenue Impact:**
- **Direct**: 
  - Prevent $5M/year in fraud losses
  - Reduce $200K/year in manual review costs
  - Avoid $300K/year in regulatory fines
- **Indirect**: 
  - 15% increase in customer trust scores
  - 25% faster transaction processing
  - 5% increase in digital channel adoption

**Customer Experience Impact:**
- **Quantifiable**: 
  - Reduce false declines from 5% to 1% (affects $10M transactions/month)
  - Decrease transaction processing time from 3 seconds to 0.5 seconds
  - Improve customer satisfaction score from 7.2 to 8.1 (10-point scale)
